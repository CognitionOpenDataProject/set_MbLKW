For this article you should focus on the findings of Experiment 1 reported in section 2.1.2. Results and discussion. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> The participantsâ€™ answers were converted to a 7-point Likert scale for analysis. Participants judged the mental state described in fear-type verbs to last significantly longer than those described by frighten-type verbs (t(256) = 19.9, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). 18 of the fear-type verbs (42%) were judged to have longer durations than any of the frighten-type verbs, and 153 of the frighten-type verbs (71%) were judged to have shorter durations than any of the fear-type verbs.

**Note**
Make sure to use the original article for additional context and information about any necessary pre-processing steps. Also check for additional supplementary materials that may provide supporting documentation for analysis procedures.
